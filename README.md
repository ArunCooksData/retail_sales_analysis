# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis | SQL Project 📊

Welcome to the **Retail Sales Analysis Project**, where I explored a rich retail dataset using **SQL** to uncover valuable insights, identify business trends, and answer key questions. This project focuses on leveraging SQL queries to solve real-world business problems.
